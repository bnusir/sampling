# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
   While this is good for exploratory purposes and thus may yield valuable insights into preferences for music across different age groups, targeting the educated and urban samples in particular, it does not generalize perfectly to the target population. Future studies could achieve this through the use of random sampling methods and advertising their request for respondents through broader recruitment channels, such as community organizations or public spaces.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    After Reflecting the above on my previous survey, I would change the following:
    1. Introduction: 
    "Thank you for taking this survey. This research aims to understand how music tastes vary with age and over the course of a lifetime. Please be assured that your answers will be strictly anonymous and used only for academic purposes. In continuation of this survey, consent is hereby given for participation in this study."

        Reason: participant will have clear purpose of the survey and can decide to participate or not, also we are assuring the participant their answers will be strictly anonymouse, and obtain informed consent.

    2. Reduced Response Bias:
        
    Add response options that were neutral in nature when they had not existed, such as "No preference". This ensures that participants are not forced into giving a polarized answer that may not be true about their sentiments.

    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?\
An observational study might only examine existing data or behavior and never interact with a subject. For example:
Social Networks and Streaming Platforms:
We can find the current music preferences for every age group by considering the trends in either the pattern of music listening, playlists, or streaming on platforms like Spotify or YouTube.
While this would be partly achievable through an observational study, for example, differences based on current music taste between the younger and older people-the nature of lifetime changes in tastes and personal perceptions of popular music could only be poorly captured. A survey is thus necessary to collect the detailed, subjective, and reflective data central to the purpose of this study.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
